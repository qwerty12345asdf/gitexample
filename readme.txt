hello world this is the next big change to the project 
a complete overhaul to the project is going to take place hope you like it .
hey guys i was trying to understand how vcs works so it seems that i may possibly have it 
first we commit the changes after every single time we make one for ex. now ...
once committed the committed data that is whatever we changed will now get saved and we can just continue working it is very similar to saving except now your changes will be logged every time you commit the file .
In the end what you have to do is push the file so that it can be saved to a remote server in this case github here we can see the various commits done to the file 
alternatively we can view the commits by using the command "git log"
